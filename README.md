# AgroRecommend
🌾 Crop Recommendation System
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts choose the most suitable crops for their land. By analyzing various factors like soil type, weather conditions, and other environmental data, this system predicts the best crops to plant, maximizing yield and promoting sustainable farming practices.

📜 Features
Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crop based on soil data, weather conditions, and past performance.
Data Analysis: Evaluates soil properties (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels) and other environmental factors.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface that provides recommendations with minimal input.
Sustainable Farming: Helps farmers make decisions that enhance productivity while maintaining soil health.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.
Frontend: Flask (for web deployment) 
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

🧑‍💻 Usage
Input Soil and Environment Data: Enter the required values for soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH level, temperature, and humidity.
Receive Crop Recommendations: The system will analyze the data and suggest the best crop for your land.

🗂️ Datasets
The dataset used for this project includes various parameters like:

Soil data: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH levels.
Weather data: Temperature, humidity, rainfall.

🧠 Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models are used to predict the best crop:

Random Forest: For classification and robust predictions.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): To classify the best crop based on feature similarity.
Decision Tree: To visualize and understand the decision-making process.
The model with the highest accuracy is used for final recommendations.
